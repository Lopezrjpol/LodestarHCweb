                <p>Employees have a duty of loyalty to the Company and are therefore expected to always act in the Company’s best interests. A conflict arises when the personal interests or activities of an employee influence or have the potential to influence the exercise of his or her judgment in the performance of his or her duties. Conflicts of interest and even the appearance of a conflict of interest may compromise the Company’s reputation and must be avoided.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, the Company also respects its employees' right to privacy in their personal activities and financial affairs. It is the responsibility of each employee to ensure that his or her personal conduct complies with the following principles and make the proper disclosures, whenever applicable, to allow the Company to determine and address conflicts of interests’ issues.

                <p>The Company recognizes that Related Party Transactions can present potential or actual conflicts of interest and may raise questions about whether such transactions are consistent with the Company’s and its stockholders’ best interests. Policies mandating the review and approval of Related Party Transactions should be adopted in order to set forth the procedures under which certain transactions must be reviewed and approved or ratified.(Amended Corporate Governance Manual Sec. 11 (http://www.lodestarholdings.com/site/assets/files/1030/amended_lihc_cgm_2017.pdf))</p>
