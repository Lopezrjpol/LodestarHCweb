      <p className={styles.text}>On January 3, 1974, Lodestar Mining Corporation (now Lodestar Investment Holdings Corporation) (“LIHC” or the Company”) was incorporated in the Philippines and established primarily as a mining and natural resources exploration company. The Company was engaged in the development of several gold and chromite mining claims in Masbate, Cebu, Negros Occidental and Palawan.</p>
      <p className={styles.text}>In 1988, the Company filed an application for listing of its 30,000,000 common shares with the Philippine Stock Exchange (“PSE”) formerly known as the Manila and Makati Stock Exchanges. On October 11, 1988, the SEC issued to the Company a Certificate of Permit to Offer Securities for Sale and rendered the Registration Statement to be effective. The Company was able to complete its initial public offering and the listing of the Company’s shares was made effective on May 26, 1989.</p>
      <p className={styles.text}>In October 2003, the name and primary purpose of the Company were changed from a mining company to an investment holding company</p>
      <p className={styles.text}>On July 21, 2015, the Company entered into Cancellation of the Heads of Agreement, Amended Heads of Agreement and Allied Contracts with Abacus Consolidated Resources Holdings, Inc. (ABACORE) and Abacus Coal Exploration and Development Corporation (ABACOAL). The cancellation was necessitated by the fact that the Merger with ABACOAL was not approved by LIHC shareholders for lack of quorum during the Annual Shareholder’s Meeting called for the three (3) years prior. Thus, the Company no longer has any contractual interest over ABACOAL as a result of the cancellation of other Heads of Agreement and its allied contracts.</p>
      <p className={styles.text}>On October 25, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the execution, delivery and implementation of the Subscription Agreement with Mr. Nathaniel C. Go for the subscription, via private placement, to two hundred sixty million (260,000,000) shares at the subscription price of ten centavos (P 0.10) per share.

Lim, for the subscription, via private placement, to two billion (2,000,000,000) shares at the subscription price of ten centavos (P 0.10) per share. The subscribed shares were issued out of the increase in the Company’s authorized capital stock from one hundred million pesos (P100,000,000.00) consisting of one billion (1,000,000,000) common shares with a par value of ten centavos (P0.10) per share to three hundred million pesos (P300,000,000.00) consisting of three billion (3,000,000,000) common shares, with a par value of ten centavos ( (P0.10) per share.
